# JavaScript Learning Projects

My JavaScript learning journey!
In this folder, you'll find a collection of small projects that I'm building as part of my learning process. These projects are designed to help me grasp JavaScript concepts and eventually lead up to a bigger, more comprehensive project.

## Learning Resources

- **ALX**: I'm learning JavaScript through ALX's comprehensive program.
- **Coursera**: I'm also taking a frontend software development course on Coursera which includes JavaScript to deepen my understanding.
- **FreeCodeCamp**: FreeCodeCamp is another great resource where I'm working on practical projects to reinforce my learning.
- **YouTube**: I explore various YouTube tutorials and resources to add to my learning experience.

## Project Structure

Each project in this folder represents a specific concept or skill that I'm learning. As I progress, I'll be adding more projects and refining existing ones to showcase my growth in JavaScript development.

## Projects List

1. **Project 1**: A Counter Program
2. **Project 2**: A Random Number Generator
3. **Project 3**: A payment selection program
